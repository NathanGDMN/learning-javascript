You want to define functions within <script> tags as they are loaded when you open a page and then call them within other objects.

Any variables defined within a function are limited to only being used within said function.

If you want to define a global variable, you can declare a variable within the <script> tags but outside of any function.

To define pararmeters for a function simply include thier name within the brackets during the function declaration:
    function calculateTax(cost, taxPercent){...}
You can set default values for these parameters by setting them equal to something within this declaration.
    function calculateTax(cost, taxPercent = 0.1){...}
