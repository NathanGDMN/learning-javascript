Conventions:
-Use single quotes as much as you can ''
-Only us double qutoes when you have to
    -Like when needing quotes inside of another string
-If you need to insert  a value into a string or write on multiple lines use a template string

Template Strings
-Declared using ``
-Ex. Interpolation (inserting values into string)
    Goal: 'Items (2): $28.94'
    With concatenation:
        'Items (' + (1+1) + '): $' + (2095+799)/100
    With template string:
        `Items (${1+1}): $${(2095+799)/100}`
-Template strings allow multiline strings:
    `some
    text`
