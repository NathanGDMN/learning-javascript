You can still edit arrays when you declare them with const.

If you want to check if a variable is an array, you can use Array.isArray(array1);
    If you use typeof it will return object not array

Because arrays are objects they have built-in some attributes and methods
    .length (length of array)
    .push() (appends element between the brackets to the end of the array)
    .splice(i, j) (removes j elements from array starting at index i)

Arrays in javascript can hold values of different types.
    ex.  [1, 'hello', true, {name: 'socks'}, [1,2]]

When to use each kind of loop:
    For loops - for standard loops (have an increment, and set number of iterations you want to run)
    While loops - for non-standard loops (no increment step, and an unclear amount of iterations)

You can use CSS grids to align multiple items into columns using the display: grid;. By giving this property to a <div> all elements in said div will be placed into the columns, in a snake order. Ex. Grid with three columns:
    | 1 | 2 | 3 |
    | 4 | 5 | 6 |

    The property grid-template-columns allows you to format your grid:
        Ex. grid-template-columns: 200px 150px 100px; -creates three columns of widths: 200px, 150px, 100px; respectively

    column-gap allows you to edit the spacing between columns.
    row-gap allows you to edit the spacing between rows.
        *Note only applys spacing between elements of the grid if another grid is adjacent, will not apply spacing between that grid's elements and the current one
    
    align-items allows you to choose how elements in the grid are alligned.
        By default, align-items is set to stretch, this means than elements in the grid are stretched to fill thier 'cell'
        You can use align-items: center; to center text elements in a grid.
