Styles can be added to your webpage by having a <style> tag in the <head> of your webpage.

Styles can be changed using javascript by adding or removing classes from the document.queryselector('.object').classList using .add() and .remove()
    -Then having specific styles for the added classes

You can manually add extra classes to a element by simply writting a second classname withing the class attribute and seperating the classes with a space. Ex. class= "class1 class2"

*The order in which styles are declared in the <style> tag determines how they are applied.
    -Styles declared first will be applied first, styles declared after will override earlier styles if there is any conflicting style assignments.

Notes on style:
    -Padding is space inside an element
        -You can manually assign a padding-top, padding-bottom, padding-left and padding-right, within an element. But you can also simply define a 'padding' style.
            Ex. padding: 10px; //Adds 10px of padding to all sides within an element
            Ex. padding: 10px 15px; //Adds 10px of padding to the top and bottom of an element and 15px of padding to the left and right of an element
    -Margin is space outside an element
    -text is usually edited using 'font' and not 'text'
    -the 'cursor' property allows you to change what the cursor looks like when hovering over an element

Seperating HTML, CSS, and JS into seperate files:
-HTML file still acts as the main file.
-JS can be linked to the HTML file by using <script src="filepath"></script> within the <body>
-CSS can be linked to the HTML file by using <link rel="stylesheet" href="filepath">
