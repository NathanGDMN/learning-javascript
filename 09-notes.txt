The DOM is simply a built-in object in javascript.

The DOM - Document Object Model, represents/models the wedpage.
    -By changing the 'document' object you change the webpages

document.querySelector('element'), allows us to select and return any html 'element' from javascript.
    -Ex. document.querySelector('element') retrieves the first <button> element from the html
    -You can target specific elements--not just the first one, by giving the interested object a class property then looking for that class in the query selector: document.querySelector('.js-elementClass')
        -When you are giving a class a name for the sole purpose of using it within JS it is common practice to start the class name with the prefix 'js-'


every retrieved html element (whether that's through query select or or document.body.element), has an innerHtml property that allows you to change the html within the element
    -*innerHtml also returns any formatting withing your html, if you simply wanted to change the text within a button for example, you could use .innerText instead to return the text without the formatting (see 09-dom-projects)

certain html elements called 'block elements' tak up an entire line all by themselves ex.<p>

You can get <input> values from the DOM using document.querySelector('input').value. *Whenever you get a value from the DOM it will be a string

Methods onclick and onkeydown are called event listeners, when triggered they produce an event object that can be used. (See 09-dom-projects)

All objects we have been using so far belong to the 'window' object. The window object represents the browser. Examples of what it contains are: the console (window.console), pop-ups(window.alert), the DOM (window.document).
    -By default, you do not need to type 'window." when you want to access these objects
