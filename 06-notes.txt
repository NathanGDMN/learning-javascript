Comparison Operators:
>: Greater Than
<: Less Than
>=: Greater Than or Equal To 
<=: Less Than or Equal To 

===: Equal To
==: Equal To (with conversion to same type)
!==: Not equal to
!=: Not equal to (with conversion to same type)
    *By default only use === and !==.

Comparision Operators have a lower order of operations thatn math operators.

Logical Operators then come after comparision operators

Logical Operators:
&& -  AND
|| - OR
! - NOT

Scope with '{}':
-Any variable created within '{}' will only exist within said brackets

Truthy and Falsy Values:
-All falsy values:
    false, 0, '', 
    NaN, -Comes from illegal math  
    undefined, -A declared (non-constant) variable, with no assigned value
    null - Learn later
-The rest are truthy

If statements, shortcut operators:
?, : - Ternary Operator, way of shortening if statements and allows them to be stored in  variables
&& -  Guard Operator, can be used outside if conditions to only allow the operation to the right of the '&&' to run when the operation to the left of the '&&' is true. can also be store in variables
|| - Default Operator, can be used outside if conditions to only allow the operation to the right of the '||' to run when the operation to the left of the '||' is false. can also be store in variables
